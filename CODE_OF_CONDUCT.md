# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- **Being respectful and inclusive**: Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- **Being collaborative**: Working together toward common goals.
- **Being empathetic**: Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
- **Being professional**: Maintaining a courteous and high-standard demeanor.
- **Prioritizing the Community**: Focusing on what's best for the collective benefit of the project.

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- **Harassment**: The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- **Trolling**: Deliberately provocative, insulting, or offensive comments.
- **Privacy Violations**: Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- **Discrimination**: Any form of exclusion based on personal characteristics or identity.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers via the GitHub repository's issue tracker or private contact methods. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
